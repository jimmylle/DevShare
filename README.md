# What is this?

This is a little side project that I wanted to try to learn some cool things like:
- ruby on rails
- react
- WebRTC stuff like sockets, etc.
- Trying integration tools like houndci, code climate, continuous integration, etc.
- CSS modules

How much I work on this depends really on how busy I am.
