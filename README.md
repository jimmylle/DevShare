# What is this?

This is a little side project that I wanted to try to learn some cool things like:
- ruby on rails
- react
- WebRTC stuff like sockets, etc.
- Trying integration tools like houndci, code climate, continuous integration, etc.
- CSS modules

How much I work on this depends really on how busy I am.

# Notes

### 9/26/2017
- Huh, maybe ruby on rails isn't the best backend for this project. Maybe nodejs
would have been a better choice?
- For now I'll work with rails and get it working with it and then maybe do it again
with nodejs or switch to nodejs if it's too dificult on rails.
